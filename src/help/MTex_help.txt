------------ The MTEX texture model and method -----------------

MTEX is a texture package for all kind of computation and processing concerning texture.
This plugin/model, uses the MTEX binaries by Ralf Hielscher to calculate an ODF from the
automatically exported pole figures extracted by MAUD. After the ODF computation, the ODF
is used to recalculate the pole figures and correct the pattern. This is done at every
iteration cycle to progressively refine the extracted and exported pole figures and
the next ODF. The MTEX binaries come from MTEX version 4.5.2. The version for Mac M1-2
processor was recompiled by L. Lutterotti from the source code downloaded from the
MTEX Github web site.

If you use it, please cite one of the papers of Ralf about MTEX you can find at the
web site below. A specific paper for this implementation is in the working.

This model in MAUD would not work or exist if not for the Java package of Florian Bachmann
that made a Java interface to MTEX that MAUD is using to run MTEX and transfert data
back and forth between the two programs.
Thanks also go to Daniel Savage who revise and debugged the method to made it working
finally. The final implementation was finalised during my stay at LANSCE, Los Alamos National
Labs. working with Sven Vogel and Daniel.

From the MTEX web site: MTEX comes with binaries from the NFFT which build up the core of MTEX.

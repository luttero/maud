/**
 * Class representing an option that will be passed to the JVM at startup.
 * The class can optionally be named, which allows the bundled Java program
 * itself to override the option. Changes will take effect upon restart of the
 * application.<p>
 * Assuming your {@code CFBundleIdentifier} (settable via {@link AppBundlerTask#setIdentifier(String)})
 * is {@code com.oracle.appbundler}. Then you can override a named option by calling
 * <xmp>
 *     import java.util.prefs.Preferences;
 *     [...]
 *     Preferences jvmOptions = Preferences.userRoot().node("/com/oracle/appbundler/JVMOptions");
 *     jvmOptions.put("name", "value");
 *     jvmOptions.flush();
 * </xmp>
 * The corresponding entries will be stored in a file called
 * {@code ~/Library/Preferences/com.oracle.appbundler.plist}.
 * To manipulate the file without Java's {@link java.util.prefs.Preferences} from the command line,
 * you should use the tool
 * <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/defaults.1.html">defaults</a>.
 * For example, to add an entry via the command line, use:
 * <xmp>
 *     defaults write com.oracle.appbundler /com/oracle/appbundler/ -dict-add JVMOptions/ '{"name"="value";}'
 * </xmp>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<hr>

<p>Here are the instructions to perform a quantitative analysis on a ZrO2/Al2O3 powder
sample. We suppose the user has collected a spectrum using an x-ray diffractometer.The
procedure will start creating a basic analysis file setting up the instrument, the
dataset, the phases and the sample.We will build this analysis file in four steps: 

<ul>
  <li>Step 1: create and define the instrument</li>
  <li>Step 2: create dataset and load the datafile</li>
  <li>Step 3: load and modify the phases</li>
  <li>Step 4: define the sample</li>
</ul>

<p>Once defined the analysis file, we will start the analysis following two steps: 

<ul>
  <li>Step 5: set up some &quot;visible&quot; parameters (specifically, the T-PSZ cell
    parameters)</li>
  <li>Step 6: select the iterations number and refine the spectrum</li>
</ul>

<p>The final step (Step 7) will show the analysis output to the user. The tutorial will
also guide the user to a more accurate and precise analysis if some parameters were not as
expected.</p>

<p>The tutorial has been added by several figures to help the novice in figuring out
easily the basic procedure to perform this kind of analysis.</p>

<p>Well, try this tutorial and e-mail us for any problem or question (see the <a
href="contacts.html">contacts</a> webpage for more information on the authors). For those
already expert, a new manual in PDF format will soon be available in order to explain all
the features of MAUD.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<hr>

<p>
  Here are the instructions to perform a Rietveld quantitative analysis on a ZrO2/Al2O3 powder sample using Maud.<br>
  <b>Version 2.03 (released September 12, 2005) or higher is needed for this tutorial.</b> <br>
  The spectrum for the analysis has been collected using a standard Bragg-Brentano diffractometer and the data file is
  located in the datasets and examples directory of Maud (the one created by you at the first run of the program).
  The procedure will start creating a basic analysis file setting up the datafile and the two phases to analyze.<br>
  We will build this analysis file in two steps:

<ul>
  <li>Step 1: load the datafile</li>
  <li>Step 2: load and modify the phases</li>
</ul>

<p>Once defined the analysis file, we will start the analysis following two steps: 

<ul>
  <li>Step 3: set up some &quot;visible&quot; parameters (specifically, the T-PSZ cell parameters)</li>
  <li>Step 4: refine the spectrum by the wizard</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The final step (Step 5) will show the analysis output to the user.
  The tutorial will also guide the user to a more accurate and precise analysis if some parameters were not as expected.
</p>

<p>
  The tutorial has been added by several figures to help the novice in figuring out easily the basic procedure to
  perform this kind of analysis.

  For those already expert, a new manual in PDF format will soon be available in order to explain all the features of
  MAUD.

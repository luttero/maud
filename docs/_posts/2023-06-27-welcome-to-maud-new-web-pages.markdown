These are the new web pages hosted on github where also the complete source code of Maud can be found!
We apologies for the problems on the old one as well as the long downtime of all the related pages, info, tutorials ones.
The new hosting will be more reliable not anymore based on a single computer in my office. It will be also more accessible as no more bound to a not standard port as it was the previous one.

Check out the [MAUD docs][maud-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of MAUD. To start tutorials are probably the best and can be found at [MAUD tutorials][maud-tutorials]. To download the program check on [MAUD download][maud-download].
